Master Unsupervised Learning 


## ✅ Setup Env
- Create Python environment\
`conda create -n env_name python=3.10`\
`conda activate env_name`
- Create Python environment\
`pip install -r .\path_to_requirements\requirements.txt`


## ✅ Unsupervised learning's journey:
- Unsupervised learning
  - Practical examples:
    - Voice categorization
    - Document categorization
- Clustering algorithm
  - Quantifying similarities
    - Euclidean distance measure
    - Manhattan distance measure
    - Cosine distance measure
  - k-means
    - Advantages:
      - Simplicity
    - Limitations
      - The initial number of clusters has to be predetermined
      - The initial assignment of cluster centers is random. 
      - Each data point is assigned to only one cluster
      - Sensitive to outliers
  - Hierarchical clustering
    - dendrogram
  - Application of clustering
    - In government use cases:
      - Crime-hotspot analysis
      - Demographic social analysis
    - In market search:
      - Market segmentation
      - Targeted advertisements
      - Customer categorization
- Dimensionality reduction
  - Feature selection
  - Feature aggregation
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A linear unsupervised ML algorithm
    - Linear discriminant analysis (LDA). A linear supervised ML algorithm
    - Kernel principal component analysis. A nonlinear algorithm
