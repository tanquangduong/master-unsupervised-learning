Master Unsupervised Learning 


## ✅ Setup Env
- Create Python environment\
`conda create -n env_name python=3.10`\
`conda activate env_name`
- Create Python environment\
`pip install -r .\path_to_requirements\requirements.txt`


## ✅ Unsupervised learning's journey:
- Unsupervised learning
  - Practical examples:
    - Voice categorization
    - Document categorization
- Clustering algorithm
  - Quantifying similarities
    - Euclidean distance measure
    - Manhattan distance measure
    - Cosine distance measure
  - k-means
    - Advantages:
      - Simplicity
    - Limitations
      - The initial number of clusters has to be predetermined
      - The initial assignment of cluster centers is random. 
      - Each data point is assigned to only one cluster
      - Sensitive to outliers
  - Hierarchical clustering
    - 
- Dimensionality reduction
- Anomaly detection algorithm
- Association rules mining
